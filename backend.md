# Backend Team (a.k.a. The Best End)

## Purpose
The Backend Team exists to quietly carry the entire project on its back while pretending everything is “just working.”
We build the core systems, wire the logic, move the data, and make sure the app doesn’t fall apart when someone clicks a button.

In short: **no backend, no product.**

---

## Why We’re the Best Team
- We deal with reality (data, logic, scale, security)
- We fix problems nobody sees and prevent problems nobody knows about
- We turn vague ideas into actual functioning systems
- We make frontends possible

Frontend makes it *look good*.
Backend makes it *exist*.
